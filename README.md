# programming assignment 3

this project implements six different algorithms that perform a variety of tasks- the first, the staircase, creates a staircase with "x"s based on the input of how many rows the user inputs. the second, the fibonacci algorithm, returns a string of fibonacci sequence for n iterations based on user input. the third, the multiplication table, returns a string multiplication table based on two user inputs, n, the number being multiplied and N, the number of rows. the fourth, mostChar, calculates the most repeated character in a given string. the fifth, pascal's triangle, returns the infamous pascal's triangle for the user's input of n number of rows. the last algorithm, the triangular square, returns a square with a diamond inside for n number of rows, based on user input.
